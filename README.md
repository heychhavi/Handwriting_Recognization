# Handwriting_Recognization
A dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9. Here I used MNIST dataset for handwriting recognition.

This MNIST classifier trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. stop training once reached that level of accuracy.
